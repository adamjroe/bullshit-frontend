## Frontend

Welcome to the frontend. Our application consists of a separate frontend and
backend. They are mostly independent and communicate through a RESTful API.

### Getting started

Start your console and switch to the frontend folder. Before starting the App
you have to install the dependencies with npm:
```
npm install
```

Now you can start the development server:
```
node server.js
```

You can now view the application in your browser on port 3000
(type `localhost:3000` in the URL bar).
Modules are hot reloaded which means you can see your saved changes without
refreshing the browser window. For more information on the topic see
- [Webpack Hot Module Replacement Documentation](https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/hot-module-replacement-with-webpack)
- [React Hot Loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader)

### Taking the challenges

We created challenges for you to work on. You can find them in the subfolder
`challenges/`. The challenges build on top of each other so make sure to start
with the first task.
