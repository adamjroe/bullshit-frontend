# Kiron's Student Platform Stack
Welcome to the slimmed-down version of Kiron's technology stack. Kiron is all offering access to higher education to refugees wordlwdie. We are a non-profit based in Berlin, Germany. Our tech team is global, and we are always looking for volunteers to help out on projects. This repository serves as a playground for you to get comfortable with the libraries and frameworks used at Kiron's product called _Student Platform_.

For more information on what we do and what Kiron Open Higher Education is all about visit our [website](https://kiron.university).

The Kiron Student Platform is built on a demanding, modern javascript  stack to provide a top-notch experience in a single page app. The frontend is React.js, the backend is the Node.js based Sails. We use Redux to manage the state. There are a number of other libraries built in, like Bootstrap. This stack example represents a bare-bones version of our stack. At the moment there is only a frontend here, though we are building a backend as well. The two are independent of each other; if you are interested in the frontend only, just go straight there. 

### Quickstart Guide.

### Introduction to the Kiron Stack: Getting Setup

Here is some information to help you get rolling along, whether you are doing backend or frontend. There are lots of ways to program javascript. We are following the [AirBnB Javascript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript), this should be your reference. We are coding in ES6. 

Most of our programmers use the light, fast and efficient text editor [Atom](https://atom.io/). Atom has an ES6 Linter that can be set using the AirBnB guide. After setting up Atom, you will want to [add the packages](https://atom.io/docs/v1.2.4/using-atom-atom-packages) `linter`, `linter-eslint`, and `react`
